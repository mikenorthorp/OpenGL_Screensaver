This is assignment #1 for my OpenGL Animation class, written in C.

It is a "screensaver" application that displays the letter of my last name. You can click various buttons
to morph it into a star, have a sparkle spin/grow/shrink around the outline of the letter, have the
sparkle (kinda) shoot sparks out, and a nice bonus effect. It demonstrates various functionality of openGL
and freeglut in C.

Requirements
------------

This program requires `C`, `freeGlut`, and `GLEW`.

This program is made to run in Visual Studio 2012, and you will have to configure the
freeglut libraries and linkers when running this on your own copy most likely.

A basic tutorial on how to get set up is found here [Setup](http://www.wyzant.com/resources/blogs/226103/opengl_freeglut_and_visual_studio_2012)

Installation
------------

1. Open the project in Visual studio, or grab the screensaver.c file and set it up in
   your own environment.
2. Ensure you have `freeGlut`, and `GLEW` installed properly.

Making the Program Do Things
----------------------------

1. Click the buttons to see their effects.
2. To exit the program just hit the exit button in the corner.
